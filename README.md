# Full-Stack Interview — Product Catalog

A monorepo containing a **React + MUI** frontend and a **NestJS** backend, scaffolded with pnpm workspaces.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 18
- **pnpm** >= 9 (`corepack enable` to activate)

### Install & Run

```bash
# Install all dependencies
pnpm install

# Start both frontend and backend in dev mode
pnpm dev

# Run all tests
pnpm test
```

| App      | URL                       |
| -------- | ------------------------- |
| Frontend | http://localhost:5173     |
| Backend  | http://localhost:3000/api |

## The Challenge

You have **1 hour** to build a product catalog with wishlist functionality. We are not expecting a complete product, so you do not need to complete everything. We are however looking for **production-ready code**

The backend serves product data from a JSON file, and the frontend displays it. Your job is to build out both sides.

### What's Already Built

- **Backend**: A single `GET /api/store-name` route that returns `{ "name": "The Tech Library" }`. CORS is configured for the frontend origin.
- **Frontend**: Fetches the store name on mount and displays it in a Material-UI `AppBar`. A placeholder area below reads _"Product Library will go here"_.
- **Data**: `apps/backend/src/data/products.json` contains 10 mock products with `id`, `name`, `type`, and `price` fields.
- **Tests**: Passing unit tests for the existing store-name endpoint and App component.

### What Are We Expecting?

We're looking for **production-ready code**, not a finished product. If time runs out before you complete every feature, that's perfectly fine — we'd much rather see well-structured, thoughtful code for fewer features than rushed code that ticks every box. Your solution must be something you would feel comfortable opening as a real pull request within an engineering team.

In practice, that means:

- **Clean, readable code** — clear naming, small focused functions/components, and consistent style.
- **Proper error handling** — don't let things fail silently; surface meaningful feedback.
- **Sensible project structure** — organise files and modules in a way that scales.
- **Type safety** — leverage TypeScript the way it's intended.
- **Testing** — write tests that give you confidence the code works, not just coverage for the sake of it.
- **Good API design** — appropriate status codes, validation, and predictable behaviour.
- **Passes technical validation** - your solution should successfully build/run and pass all basic technical validation checks (e.g. linting, formatting, tests)

Think of it as: _"If this were going into a real codebase, would I be happy to open a PR with this?"_

### Core Requirements

Build a UI that displays the product catalog and allows users to add items to a wishlist. The wishlist can be managed in-memory on the backend. You will need to add appropriate API endpoints to support this functionality. The product list can be filtered by type, and each product should have an "Add to Wishlist" button. You are able to design the UI as you see fit, but it should be clear and user-friendly.

You can add any additional packages or tools you think are necessary to complete the task. Focus on writing clean, maintainable code and demonstrating your understanding of full-stack development principles.

---

### Extension Tasks

_If you finish the core requirements early, pick from these:_

1. **Wishlist page** — Add endpoints and a separate view that displays all wishlisted items.
2. **Remove from wishlist** — Allow items to be removed from the wishlist.
3. **Search** — Allow the product list to be filtered by a search term.
4. **Duplicate prevention** — Return an appropriate error if a product is already in the wishlist.

## Can I Use AI?

Yes, you can use AI tools to assist you! However, we want to see your understanding and problem-solving skills. If you use AI-generated code, please make sure to:

- Understand the code you're using and be able to explain it.
- Modify and adapt it to fit the requirements of the challenge.
- Document any AI assistance in your README, including **ALL** prompts you used.

---

## Submission

Please submit your completed code as a GitHub repository link. Include a README with:

- Instructions to run the project.
- Any assumptions or decisions you made.
- If you used AI, a brief note on how you used it.
- Any additional features you implemented beyond the core requirements.
